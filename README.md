# Warsow race

Some basic features to make vanilla Warsow race playable.

## Main changes

* Fixed the respawner after finishing.
* Allow racerestart while not racing.
* Linked kill to racerestart.
* Fixed displaying of the top scores in the hud. They are now shown when you
  connect.
* Save no more than one time per player to the local highscore file, so the
  highscores are not populated by one player.
* Print finish and sector times to the console so they can be looked at later.
* Assign saved top times to their owners when they reappear.
* Added practicemode with noclip and position save / load commands.
* Disabled warmup.
