# Warsow race

Devs are not going to do much about race, so I decided to do some 'essential'
stuff myself.

## Current changes

The most important changes made are:

* Fixed the respawner after finishing (scheduled for 1.01 too).
* Allow racerestart in pre-race.
* Fixed displaying of the top scores in the hud. They are now loaded when you
	connect.
* Print finish and sector times to the console so they can be looked at later.
* Assign saved top times to their owners.
* Added practicemode with noclip and position save/load commands.
* Disabled warmup

## Todo
