# Warsow race

Devs are not going to do much about race, so I decided to do some 'essential'
stuff myself.

## Current changes

* Fixed the respawner after finishing (scheduled for 1.01 too).
* Allow racerestart in pre-race.
* Fixed displaying of the top scores in the hud. They are now loaded when you
	connect.

## Todo

* Print finish and sector times after finishing.
* Add practicemode.
